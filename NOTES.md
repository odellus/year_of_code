I'm having problems with the FT-5 I bought from FolgerTech. The MKS Gen v1.4 board I bought on Amazon burned out after I wired it up incorrectly, at least I think that's what's wrong. I can't get arduino to load the marlin firmware to the board. At least I only have myself to blame for the problem and I got the board for free anyway because it took so long to get here.

I've been looking at open source 3d printer designs on Thingiverse that I can put together with a little help from the FT-5 once I get it working. I'm feeling a lot more calm and collected about the whole debacle now anyway.

$500 is just the price I've paid to get started down to path to 3D printerdom and desktop manufacturing glory.

I've been working on translating the polygon2voxel codes written in C and Matlab over to NumPy. I copied the C code pretty much verbatim and now I'm just learning about SWIG and numpy.i type maps.
